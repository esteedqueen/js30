# Day 1

What I learnt
keycode.info - pretty handy tool and resource for key codes. Doesn't work with complex keys such as `shift key + 8`. Maybe I should submit a PR for that.

I learnt/was reminded about using `transitionend` event listerner, `querySelectorAll` with a `forEach` loop for the `NodeList` returned, `template literals` syntax, audio `currentTime` method, adding and removing css class selectors with `classList.add` and `classList.remove` in vanilla JS with Jquery.
