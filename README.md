This repo contains my work following the [Javascript 30](https://javascript30.com/) course by Wes Bos.

An exercise in complete variety of mini tasks/projects in pure vanilla Javascript.

My goal is to spend spending 30mins - 1hr each day for the next 30 days.

Each day will have it's own readme on short notes and learnings.

Don't forget the second step...

> The first step is learning how to do it. Finding and obtaining the insight and the tools and the techniques you need. Understanding how it works.

> But step two is easily overlooked. Step two is turning it into a habit. Committing to the practice. Showing up and doing it again and again until you're good at it, and until it's part of who you are and what you do.

> Most education, most hardware stores, most technology purchases, most doctor visits, most textbooks are about the first step. What a shame that we don't invest just a little more to turn the work into a habit.
